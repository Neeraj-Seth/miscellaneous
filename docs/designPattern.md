### Design pattern note

#### Creational pattern
|Name              | Description                                                       |                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------
|Factory           |Create mutiple objects from `if/switch` statement                  |
|Abstract factory  |Factory's factory                                                  |
|Builder           |Build complex object from simple object, and step by step          |
|Singleton         |One of the simplest design pattern                                 |
|Prototype         |Create duplicate object while keep performance `Cloneable`         |Keep all objects in a map|


#### Structural pattern
|Name              | Description                                                       |                        |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
|Adapter           |Make two incompatible interfaces work together                     |
|Bridge            |Decouple abstraction from its implementation                       |NxM class implementation|
|Criteria          |Filter a set of object and using different criteria                |
|Composite         |Treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object         |Include a list of self  |
|Decorator         |New functionality to existing object without altering its structure|Interface inside wrapper abstract class|
|Facade            |Hide complexity and provide an unified interface                   |
|Flyweight         |Reduce number of objects created, reduce memory footprint          |Keep all object in a map|
|Proxy             |A class represents functionality of another class                  |Tow classes, one present another|
